# system-grocery-checkout

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements a grocery checkout system.

The grocery checkout system functions similarly to its real-life counterpart in which a collection of products is brought to the checkout for purchase. 
After successfully making the purchase, a receipt will be generated that will reflect the relevant transaction. 
Customer loyalty rewards membership available to accumulate points with every purchase. Ultimately optional, not mandatory. 
Reward points can be accumulated and used for discounts on future purchases. 

The way the system works is the current customer is prompted to sign in, sign up, or start their order like normal. 
The customer has the ability to add, view, and or remove products to and from their cart as they see fit. 
Products can be viewed as a whole or by department. 
Once the customer performs a proper checkout, the appropriate receipt will be generated as a numbered text file. 
An admin sign in is provided with higher priviledge functionality in order to modify the databases and the information they hold as they see fit.
